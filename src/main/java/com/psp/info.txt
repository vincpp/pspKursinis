Turn sequence (concise)

Render city summary (population, budget, attributes, buildings, turn).

Player chooses an action (build / fix / raise taxes / cut expenditure) → create & validate Action.

Execute Action (mutates City, updates Budget/Attributes).

EventGenerator draws an Event → Event.apply(city) (can be immediate or delayed effects).

Income/upkeep processed (Budget adjust).

RuleChecker evaluates loss/win (budget ≤ 0 or happiness ≤ 0 ⇒ lose; turn ≥ 100 ⇒ win).

Increment turn, notify UI observers, loop.

Design notes & extensibility (one-liners)

Keep Action and Event pure data + behavior so new ones are added without modifying engine.

Use Observer for UI to react to City or GameState changes.

Make RandomProvider injectable for deterministic tests.

Balance via EventDeck weights and Building effect composition.

Keep terminal UI thin — it should only translate player input to Actions and display model state.
